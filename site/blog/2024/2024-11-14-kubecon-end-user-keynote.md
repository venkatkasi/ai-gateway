## About the presentation

As Generative AI reshapes the industry, the demands on AI platforms have rapidly evolved. Organizations now require centralized infrastructure to manage and optimize access to self-trained, open source, and commercial AI models at scale.

In this talk, we introduce the Envoy AI Gateway, a collaborative open source effort led by engineers from [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/company/what-we-do/engineering-cto/) and [Tetrate](https://tetrate.io).

Learn how the Envoy AI Gateway, which is built atop Envoy Gateway and Envoy Proxy, provides a unified, scalable solution for model access, usage limiting, and upstream authorization.
