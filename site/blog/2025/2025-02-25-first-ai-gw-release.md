# Announcing the first Envoy AI Gateway Release ‚Äì A Community Milestone!

![Announcing the first Envoy AI Gateway Release](/img/blog/0.1-release-image.png)

Today, we're excited to announce the **0.1 release** of the **Envoy AI Gateway,** the first AI gateway built on **CNCF's [Envoy Gateway](https://gateway.envoyproxy.io/)** and backed by a thriving, growing community.

The journey to the **Envoy AI Gateway** started with a simple but powerful vision: make it easier for enterprises to integrate and scale AI in their applications.

## Where We Are Now

The **Envoy AI Gateway** is now available on GitHub and ready for developers to deploy and explore. It enables enterprises to integrate AI services through a unified API while managing authorization, cost control, and scalability with built-in features:

- ‚úÖ **Unified API** for seamless integration with multiple LLM providers (starting with **AWS Bedrock** and **OpenAI**).
- ‚úÖ **Upstream Authorization** to simplify authentication across AI providers.
- ‚úÖ **Usage Rate Limiting** based on word tokens to control costs and ensure operational efficiency.


With this release, we're making AI adoption in cloud-native environments more straightforward and accessible to organizations of all sizes.

## The Power of Community

This milestone wouldn't be possible without the incredible contributions and participation from across the industry.

**A shout out to our community members from** Tetrate, Bloomberg, WSO2, RedHat, Google, and our independent contributors who have joined discussions, provided feedback, and helped shape the roadmap.

üê± Even **the cat Mellow** has attended community meetings, proving that AI isn't just for humans\!

The momentum behind **Envoy AI Gateway** speaks to the need for an open, **collaborative** approach to GenAI infrastructure. Our contributor's and early adopters' excitement and expertise drive **innovation forward.**

## Where We're Headed

We're just getting started\! Here's a sneak peek at what's next:
- **Google Gemini 2.0 integration** out-of-the-box.
- **Provider and Model Fallback Logic** to ensure continued service availability.
- **Prompt Templating** for consistent AI interactions.
- **Semantic Caching** to optimize response efficiency and reduce costs.

The **roadmap is community-driven**, and we'd love for **more contributors** to help shape the future of AI infrastructure\!
